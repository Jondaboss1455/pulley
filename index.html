    <p>
      Pulleys are mechanical devices that help lift heavy objects more easily by changing the direction of the force applied. They consist of a wheel with a groove around its edge, through which a rope or cable passes. When you pull down on one side of the rope, the wheel turns, lifting the load on the other side. The use of pulleys dates back to ancient times; the earliest records of pulleys come from around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt, where they were used to move large stones for construction. The invention of the pulley system allowed for greater efficiency in lifting and transporting materials. Over the centuries, pulleys have evolved from simple, single-wheel setups to complex systems with multiple wheels, vastly improving their effectiveness and versatility in various applications.
